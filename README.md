Web-based application in ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework
Assignment purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to develop a web-based application using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity 
Framework. This assignment aims to provide hands-on experience with building dynamic and data-driven web 
applications by utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and integrating database operations 
through Entity Framework. By completing this assignment, you will enhance their skills in web development, 
database interaction, and the application of best practices in ASP.NET Core MVC.
In today's software development landscape, the ability to build dynamic, scalable, and maintainable web 
applications is a crucial skill. With the rapid expansion of web technologies, organizations increasingly rely on 
web-based solutions to manage and present data, engage with users, and deliver services efficiently. ASP.NET 
Core MVC is one of the most powerful and widely used frameworks for building such applications, offering a 
well-organized structure through the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Combined with Entity Framework, 
which simplifies database interactions and data management, developers can focus on crafting rich and 
interactive experiences.

This assignment will guide you through the development of a multi-functional web application that utilizes 
ASP.NET Core MVC for its architecture and Entity Framework for handling database operations. The goal is to 
not only build a functional web application but also to incorporate various agile development practices and 
modern web development techniques, such as responsive design, external API integration, and secure data 
handling.
As part of the development process, you will collaborate using GitHub. The application must have multiple 
pages, accessible through a responsive navigation menu, providing users with an intuitive interface to interact 
with different functionalities, such as CRUD operations, data retrieval from external APIs, and user 
authentication.
Additionally, you will create a custom agile methodology that outlines the approach your team will take, 
including key components like a backlog, Kanban board, and user stories to ensure transparency and structured 
workflow. GitHub’s project board will act as your Kanban board, where tasks are managed, tracked, and 
prioritized.

By the end of this assignment, you will have developed not only a web-based application but also a strong 
understanding of modern software development practices, including agile methodologies, team collaboration, 
and secure coding principles.


Assignment Goals
• Develop and Declare a Custom Agile Methodology. Create and document a custom agile 
methodology incorporating key components such as a Backlog, Kanban board, and user 
stories. Demonstrate how to manage tasks and workflow using GitHub’s built-in Kanban 
board and backlog functionality to track progress and prioritize work efficiently.

• Collaborate Effectively Using GitHub: Work collaboratively as a team using GitHub for 
version control, task management, and code integration. Utilize features like pull requests, 
branches, issues, and GitHub’s project boards to manage contributions, review code, 
resolve conflicts, and ensure smooth collaboration throughout the development process. 
A minimum of 50 commits per contributors must be conducted and a too large discrepancy 
between contributors will result in a failure.

• Create a Multi-Page Application with Navigation Menu: Design and implement a web 
application with multiple pages, each serving different functionality. Integrate a responsive 
navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate between the various sections of the 
application. The menu should be intuitive and accessible across all pages.

• Understand the ASP.NET Core MVC Architecture: Develop a clear understanding of the 
Model-View-Controller architecture and how it separates concerns within a web 
application.

• Implement Data Access with Entity Framework: Learn to use Entity Framework for data 
modeling, database interactions, and managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations efficiently. You may run the database instance locally.

• Create and Use Data Models: Develop data models that accurately represent entities in 
the database and link them to the application’s business logic.

• Work with Migrations and Code-First Approach: Gain experience using the Code-First 
approach in Entity Framework, including generating database migrations and updating 
schemas from code.

• Design User-Friendly Web Interfaces: Build responsive and user-friendly views using Razor 
Pages and ensure an intuitive user experience across different devices.

• Implement Responsive Design: Ensure the web application is responsive and works 
seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, using modern CSS frameworks (e.g., 
Bootstrap) or custom CSS media queries.

• Validate User Input: Implement input validation using Data Annotations and ensure the 
application handles incorrect or malicious user input securely. Ensure strong input 
validation and data sanitization.

• Implement Authentication and Authorization: Learn how to implement basic 
authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core to control access to different parts of the 
application. Either done with Role-based or Claims-Based Authorization.

• Work with Dependency Injection: Practice using Dependency Injection to manage the 
application's services and increase modularity and testability.

• Understand Routing in ASP.NET Core: Configure and manage routes in ASP.NET Core MVC 
to handle URL patterns effectively and direct users to appropriate controllers and actions.

• Integrate External API for Data Retrieval: Learn how to consume external APIs within the 
ASP.NET Core application to fetch and display data dynamically. This includes making HTTP 
requests, parsing JSON responses, and integrating the external data into the application's 
business logic and UI.

• Deploy the Web Application: Deploy the application to a local server, ensuring it runs 
smoothly in a production environment.
